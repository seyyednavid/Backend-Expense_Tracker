# Expense Tracker app
Welcome to the Expense Tracker application, a full-stack solution for managing and monitoring personal expenses. This project showcases a blend of technologies, combining the power of React on the frontend, Node.js and Express on the backend, and MongoDB as the database. Its core mission is to empower users in effectively managing their expenses while serving as a hands-on example of creating a full-stack web application.

# Goals:
The primary objectives of developing the Expense Tracker application were as follows:

Full-Stack Proficiency: This project aimed to provide a real-world learning experience in creating a full-stack web application. By combining frontend, backend, and database technologies, it offers practical insights into the development process.

User-Centric Expense Management: The application is designed to offer users an efficient and user-friendly tool for managing and tracking their personal expenses. It's built with user stories in mind, allowing users to accomplish the following:

# User Stories:
1 - As a user, I want to be able to add new expenses, including a title, date, and amount. This way, I can comprehensively track my spending.<br />
2 - As a user, I want the flexibility to edit or remove expenses, ensuring that my expense records are always accurate and up-to-date.<br />
3 - As a user, I want to visualize my expenses over time. The application provides bar charts for each month, showing the total expenses for that period. Additionally, I can filter expenses by selecting a specific year, which displays the corresponding bar chart.

# Technologies Used:
Frontend: This project utilizes React to provide a sleek and responsive user interface. It features bar charts for visualizing expenses.<br />

Backend: The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, offering robust server-side functionality.<br />

Database: MongoDB serves as the database for storing and managing expense data.
